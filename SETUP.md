## Project files

To get started, download or clone the respective repository's project files.

**Note**:
This very repository is not needed for running peerhaven.

## Node.js

If you install Node with the official download, you may get into permission issues.
Instead, it is recommended to install Node with the latest version of [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm); this will also install npm.

### Yarn

[Install Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) on top of npm, then install all dependencies from the project root directory:

```bash
yarn install
```
