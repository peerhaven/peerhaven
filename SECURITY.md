# Security policy

## Supported versions

The following versions of the Peerhaven ecosystem are currently being supported with security updates:

| Package   | Version | Supported |
| :-------- | :------ | :-------- |
| peerhaven | 1.x     | ✔️         |
| web       | 1.x     | ✔️         |

## Reporting a vulnerability

Should you come across a security vulnerability in a package listed above, we ask you to securely report it via e-mail to <security@peerhaven.net>.
We will get back to you as soon as possible, usually within 24 hours at most.
To keep the systems and data of the ecosystem unaffected, please do not publicly disclose the vulnerability before we have had the chance to fix it – thank you!

We will then communicate the vulnerability, and its fix, in a channel we deem appropriate, crediting you with its discovery unless you prefer otherwise.
